At the end of every battle reset the attack and defense stats on units  
All other stats will persist

or add augments dict to units. detecs value, ailments, etc


I need a way to track a unit's current position on a stage
current_pos
function update_pos

how to measure distance of tiles? Distance would be the distance in the tile id's number and letter in alphabet
do units belong to a given tile?

## Next

- allow units to move on the stage
- change repr functions to be Python expressions
- add str data model methods
- units have a way that they are facing!!!
