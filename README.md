At the end of every battle reset the attack and defense stats on units  
All other stats will persist

or add augments dict to units. detecs value, ailments, etc


I need a way to track a unit's current position on a stage
current_pos
function update_pos

how to measure distance of tiles? Distance would be the distance in the tile id's number and letter in alphabet
do units belong to a given tile?

## Next

- build a stage
- allow units to move on the stage
- how to handle depth/height?
- are tiles their own object or just dicts?


### Building a stage
take an array of the alphabet
an array of numbers 1-26
