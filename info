first check all open sides of the tile.
   return open-facing tiles as adj_tiles
   check if move_range is possible to adj_tiles



How to find adjacent tiles

also standard attack range
north -4
right +1
left  -1
down  +4

adjacent = {u: r: d: l:}

first path: x-axis -> y-axis
if that doesnt work ...
   which side of dest does not have border?
check L and R border


check open side
   move unit to first adjacent open tile
   subtract go_around
   see if unit has enough left to move to dest

if you're moving on y axis, it will be x-adjacent
if moving on x axis, it should be y-adjacent
